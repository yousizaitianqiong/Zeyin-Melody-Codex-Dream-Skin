<sub>Theme install and API config stay separate — this project never rewrites your provider settings.</sub>

## Install directly

Ordinary users first install and quit the official Codex / ChatGPT app once,
then download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Fei-Away/Codex-Dream-Skin/releases):

- macOS: open `CodexDreamSkin-vX.Y.Z.dmg` and drag the app to Applications.
- Windows: run `CodexDreamSkin-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe` and follow the wizard.

No source checkout, Node.js install, `.sh`, or `.ps1` command is required. See
the [macOS guide](./docs/install-macos.md) or
[Windows guide](./docs/install-windows.md) for unsigned first-run approval,
updates, and uninstall steps.

### One-click apply

Found a theme you like on DreamSkin.cc? **Apply** hands it to the local client
directly — no download-then-import step. Requires client v1.5.0 or newer
(v1.5.5+ recommended).

Flow and safety boundary:

- The page invokes the local app through `dreamskin://apply?version=ver_...`.
  The link can carry exactly one theme version ID — **never** an arbitrary URL,
  file path, or command — and there is no silent-apply parameter.
- The app fetches the package only from the fixed official API, and refuses
  redirects.
- A native confirmation appears first, and the app checks the version's review
  status, apply-compatibility flag, version, package size, actually downloaded
  byte count, and SHA-256.
- It then reuses exactly the same ZIP, manifest, image, and Safe CSS validation
  as a manual import.
- Success requires the real renderer to report the new theme as rendered. On a
  launch or render failure the app tries to restore the previous theme, and the
  restore is itself visibility-verified; if it cannot confirm either state it
  reports the status as unconfirmed rather than claiming a rollback.

Only themes that fully satisfy the current pack contract (background image +
`theme.json` + non-empty `theme.css` + declared `safe-css` capability) show the
one-click button. Anything else goes through the manual import below.

## Tested featured presets

### Gothic Void Crusade / 哥特虚空远征

**Special thanks to [@seansong-ideogram](https://github.com/seansong-ideogram) for designing and contributing this striking, atmospheric original gothic science-fiction work to the community.** It leads the tested featured presets and is the default theme for fresh macOS installs.

  <sub>Real injected Codex home screen (preview only)</sub>
</p>

After installing on macOS, switch directly from **Saved Themes** in the menu bar.

### Arina Hashimoto / 桥本有菜

“Arina Hashimoto / 桥本有菜” has been verified on the real Codex home screen in
both light and dark appearances. The user-provided source PNG is `1672 × 941`;
the preset's `2560 × 1440` JPEG is a standardized derived export that preserves
the source's near-16:9 composition and does not add source detail. The sidebar,
cards, project picker, and composer
shown below are native Codex controls.

  <sub>Dark · real injected screenshot; unsent input hidden during capture (preview only)</sub>
</p>

This portrait material remains in the source repository for reference and
rights review; it is excluded from public DMG and Setup.exe assets. Public
installers seed only the redistributable Gothic Void Crusade preset. Users can
still choose **Change Background** to import UI-free artwork they are entitled
to use and save it for one-click switching.

> The downloadable user source is [`docs/images/presets/arina-hashimoto-source.png`](./docs/images/presets/arina-hashimoto-source.png) (`1672 × 941`); the source-only reference preset uses the normalized derived [`background.jpg`](./macos/presets/preset-arina-hashimoto/background.jpg) (`2560 × 1440`). Do not import either screenshot above: they contain real UI and are previews only. The background is a user-provided AI-generated example, not an official OpenAI/Codex visual or endorsement; do not put it in a public installer without confirmed likeness and asset rights.

## What it does

- **Real UI** — Sidebar, cards, project picker, and input stay native. Not a fake full-window screenshot.
- **Continuous wallpaper** — One 16:9 image spans the full window; adaptive focus, safe-area, and route treatment keep native content readable.
- **Swappable art** — Drop in a UI-free image you like and it becomes your theme.
- **Saved themes** — Switch local themes from the macOS menu bar or Windows system tray.
- **One-click apply** — Hit apply on [DreamSkin.cc](https://dreamskin.cc); the client verifies origin and checksum, then installs it.
- **Theme ZIP import** — Pick an ordinary `.zip` on either platform and add a validated pack to the local library.
- **Restorable** — One-click restore to the stock look.
- **Safer path** — Local-loopback CDP inject only. No official binary or signature changes.

## Quick start

### For users: download an installer

You do not need to clone the repository, install Node.js, or run `.sh` / `.ps1`
files. Download the latest package for your platform from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Fei-Away/Codex-Dream-Skin/releases), then
follow the graphical first-run guide:

| Platform | Download | Install guide |
|------|------|----------|
| macOS | `CodexDreamSkin-vX.Y.Z.dmg` | [`docs/install-macos.md`](./docs/install-macos.md) |
| Windows | `CodexDreamSkin-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe` | [`docs/install-windows.md`](./docs/install-windows.md) |

After installation, use the menu bar (macOS) or system tray (Windows). Updates
are manual: download the new package and install over the existing one; themes
and images are preserved. Because the public packages are unsigned, a new
download may show a one-time OS security warning; the guides explain the safe
GUI approval path.

### Import a downloaded theme

For themes from DreamSkin.cc, prefer [one-click apply](#one-click-apply). The
manual `.zip` path below is the fallback, and covers packs from any other source.

Choose **Import Theme ZIP…** from the macOS menu bar app or Windows tray. Only
ordinary `.zip` files are accepted; the legacy `.dreamskin` extension is not
supported, and renaming the suffix is not a supported migration path. An
official Studio pack contains `manifest.json`, `theme.json`, and exactly one
`background.webp|jpg|png`, plus non-empty `theme.css`; `LICENSE.txt` and the
reserved `manifest.sig`. Put these files at ZIP root or inside exactly one
top-level theme folder. The importer verifies platform and minimum-client
compatibility plus every declared payload file's byte length and SHA-256.
`theme.css` must pass the local Safe CSS validator and can affect only the 12
registered parts. It is revalidated on every import and apply. `manifest.sig`
is not used for signature verification.

The local simplified ZIP must contain exactly non-empty `theme.json`, non-empty
`theme.css`, and its referenced image. That format has no official
manifest integrity or compatibility declaration and should come from a trusted
source. Limits are 32 MiB per archive, 32 entries, and 64 MiB expanded. Import
adds the pack to **Saved Themes** without changing the active theme. Identical
content is not duplicated. A newer pack with the same ID updates the saved theme
in place after the old directory identity is confirmed, and only legacy `-2`/`-3`
directories with an identical semantic fingerprint are cleaned up. If the
existing directory identity cannot be confirmed, import fails closed instead of
overwriting it; names alone are never used to delete another theme.

For a manual fallback, extract the archive and move the complete directory
containing `theme.json`, `theme.css`, and its image into the saved-theme folder:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/CodexDreamSkinStudio/themes/`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexDreamSkin\themes\`

Both controls include **Open Themes Folder**. Reopen the menu/tray after moving
the directory. Do not add another wrapper level, links, nested archives, or an
image-only folder without `theme.json`. Manual placement bypasses the ZIP
importer's archive checks, so use trusted content only.

### For developers: run from source

Platform scripts are ready — different plumbing, same goal: theme Codex.

| Platform | Dir | Entry |
|------|------|------|
| Apple Silicon / Intel Mac | [`macos/`](./macos/) | Double-click `Install Codex Dream Skin.command` |
| Windows | [`windows/`](./windows/) | `scripts/install-dream-skin.ps1` → `start-dream-skin.ps1` |

More detail:

- Mac: [`macos/README.md`](./macos/README.md)
- Windows: [`windows/README.md`](./windows/README.en.md)
- Paths: [`docs/platforms.md`](./docs/platforms.md)
- Copy-ready reference prompt guide: [`docs/reference-background-prompt-guide.en.md`](./docs/reference-background-prompt-guide.en.md)

## Feedback & contributions

- **Issues:** Use the [issue templates](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) (bug / feature). Blank issues are disabled. Please try Verify / Restore self-checks before filing bugs.
- **PRs:** Follow the [PR template](./.github/pull_request_template.md) — describe the change and tick the self-checks you actually ran (e.g. `macos/tests/run-tests.sh`, verify / restore).

## Safety

- CDP binds `127.0.0.1` only, but it has **no authentication**; another process on the same computer may still connect and inspect or control the renderer.
- Pausing the theme or stopping only the injector does not close the debug port of an already running Codex process. Use a full Restore/restart, or quit every Codex process and reopen the official app normally, to end the exposure window.
- Does not touch the official install directory or code signature.
- **Never** rewrites API Key / Base URL; relay and theme stay separate.
- See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for the complete threat model and operating guidance.

## License

- See [`macos/LICENSE`](./macos/LICENSE) (MIT) and [`macos/NOTICE.md`](./macos/NOTICE.md)
- Unofficial; Codex and related rights belong to their owners.
- People / IP material in bundled presets and previews is illustrative only — clear likeness, asset, and trademark rights before commercial redistribution.
