# Codex Dream Skin Studio

Unofficial macOS theme studio for the **official Codex Desktop** app.

Turn an image you like into one continuous full-window Codex theme. The same wallpaper runs beneath the native sidebar and main surface, while route-aware translucency keeps home, task, plugin, scheduled-task, and pull-request controls fully interactive and readable.

This project injects through **local loopback CDP**. It does **not** modify the official `.app`, `app.asar`, or code signature.

## Requirements

- macOS 13 Ventura or newer (the native DMG app declares macOS 13 as its minimum)
- Official Codex Desktop installed and launched at least once (`~/.codex/config.toml` exists)
- No global Node.js install required (uses Codex’s signed bundled Node after validation)

## Release install (recommended)

普通用户请从 [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Fei-Away/Codex-Dream-Skin/releases) 下载
`CodexDreamSkin-vX.Y.Z.dmg`，按 [`docs/install-macos.md`](../docs/install-macos.md) 的图形界面步骤
拖入 Applications。首次运行可能需要在“系统设置 → 隐私与安全性 → 仍要打开”确认一次；不需要
运行 `xattr` 或安装源码。后续更新下载新的 DMG 覆盖安装即可，用户主题和图片会保留。

## Advanced: run from source

The Release DMG above is the normal user path. The commands below are for
contributors, diagnostics, and legacy deployments.

```bash
# 1) Optional checks (needs the installed Codex/ChatGPT.app bundled Node)
./tests/run-tests.sh

# 2) Install to the stable path and create Desktop launchers
./scripts/install-dream-skin-macos.sh --no-launch

# 3) Switch to the tested featured preset, or import your own pure background
~/.codex/codex-dream-skin-studio/scripts/switch-theme-macos.sh --id preset-arina-hashimoto
# ~/.codex/codex-dream-skin-studio/scripts/customize-theme-macos.sh

# 4) Start/re-apply, verify, or restore via Desktop:
#    Codex Dream Skin.command
#    Codex Dream Skin - Customize.command
#    Codex Dream Skin - Verify.command
#    Codex Dream Skin - Restore.command

# 5) Legacy only: install the old SwiftBar menu (do not enable it beside the native app)
./Install\ Menu\ Bar.command
# Look for 🎨 Skin in the top-right menu bar
```

Install location after step 2:

| Item | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Engine | `~/.codex/codex-dream-skin-studio` |
| State / logs / user images | `~/Library/Application Support/CodexDreamSkinStudio` |
| Theme backup | under Application Support (`theme-backup.json`) |

## Legacy standalone ZIP (maintainer/offline packaging only)

To build the “double-click install” folder layout for non-git users:

```bash
./scripts/build-client-release.sh "$HOME/Desktop/Codex 主题编辑器.zip"
```

That ZIP contains a visible installer plus a hidden `.codex-dream-skin-studio`
engine and is staged as a rights-clean package with only the redistributable
Gothic Void Crusade preset. It is retained for existing offline workflows;
prefer the DMG for ordinary users, and do not share a source checkout or an
archive containing the excluded Arina reference files. Do not ship only
CSS/images.

## How it works (security boundary)

1. Discover `com.openai.codex` and validate signature / Team ID / arch / bundled Node.
2. Start Codex via user `launchd` with CDP bound to `127.0.0.1` only.
3. Accept the debug port only when it belongs to Codex (or a legitimate child).
4. Inject only into expected `app://` renderer targets.
5. Resolve the selected theme and image to real paths, then enforce 10 MB,
   `16384px`-per-side, and 50-megapixel limits before injection.
6. Keep a small injector alive across reloads and route changes.
7. Pause/Restore stops the injector only when PID, executable, script path, and
   start time match the recorded job; a stop failure preserves state and aborts.
8. Config backup/restore requires Codex to be closed, strict UTF-8, an operation
   lock, same-directory atomic replacement, and an unchanged-byte check.

CDP is powerful and unauthenticated on loopback. Another process on the same
computer may connect while the CDP-enabled Codex process is running. Removing
the CSS or stopping only the injector does not remove the debug-port launch
argument; use Restore with `--restart-codex`, or fully quit Codex and reopen it
normally, to end the exposure window. See [`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).

## Bundled presets

The public DMG seeds **Gothic Void Crusade**, contributed through PR #134, as
its redistributable default. A source checkout also contains the
**桥本有菜 / Arina Hashimoto** reference material, but the public app bundle
deliberately excludes it until independent likeness and redistribution rights
are confirmed.

The user-provided source PNG is `1672 × 941`. Its pack contains a standardized
derived `2560 × 1440` JPEG plus theme metadata; the derived export does not add
source detail. The byte-identical source PNG is archived at
[`docs/images/presets/arina-hashimoto-source.png`](../docs/images/presets/arina-hashimoto-source.png).
The [light](../docs/images/presets/arina-hashimoto-light.jpg) and
[dark](../docs/images/presets/arina-hashimoto-dark.jpg) images are real injected
Codex screenshots for preview only — never import either screenshot as a
background. The artwork is a user-provided AI-generated example, not an
official OpenAI/Codex visual or endorsement; confirm likeness and asset rights
before redistributing it.

Seeding is idempotent. Upgrades remove only retired bundled preset IDs; your
own `custom-*` themes from “换一张图” and the currently active theme copy are
never touched. Existing locally saved reference themes are not deleted by an
upgrade, but they are not copied into newly downloaded public packages.

To contribute a preset, see [`presets/README.md`](./presets/README.md).

## Import a theme ZIP

The native menu-bar app has **导入主题 ZIP…**. It accepts ordinary `.zip`
files only; `.dreamskin` is deliberately unsupported. An official Studio pack
contains `manifest.json`, non-empty `theme.json`, non-empty `theme.css`, and exactly one
`background.webp|jpg|png`, with optional `LICENSE.txt` and the
reserved `manifest.sig`. Put them at archive root or inside one top-level theme
folder. A local simplified pack must contain exactly `theme.json`, `theme.css`, and its
referenced image; because it lacks manifest integrity and compatibility data,
use that format only for trusted local content.

The importer allows at most 32 MiB compressed, 32 entries, and 64 MiB expanded.
It rejects links, traversal, nested archives, unregistered payload files, and
anything that fails theme/image validation. Official packs also verify the
platform, minimum client version, and each manifest payload's byte length and
SHA-256. Safe CSS is locally revalidated on import and every apply, then runs
only against the 12 registered parts. `manifest.sig` is reserved and not used
for signature verification; `LICENSE.txt` is preserved. Previously saved legacy
themes without CSS remain switchable and inject no additional CSS.

An import only adds to **已保存的主题**. It never replaces or applies the
active/last-known-good copy. Reimporting identical content reports a duplicate;
a newer pack with the same ID replaces the saved copy in place after its stored
identity is confirmed. Only a legacy suffix directory (`-2`, `-3`, and so on)
with an identical semantic fingerprint is consolidated; names alone never prove
that a directory is a duplicate, so ambiguous entries are preserved.

Manual fallback: choose **打开主题文件夹**, or open
`~/Library/Application Support/CodexDreamSkinStudio/themes/`, then move in the
complete extracted directory whose immediate children are `theme.json`, `theme.css`, and the
referenced image. Reopen the menu afterward. Do not add another wrapper folder;
manual placement bypasses archive checks, so use trusted content only.

## Image guidelines

- PNG / JPEG / HEIC / TIFF / WebP (macOS readable)
- Source ≤ 50 MB; prepared file ≤ 10 MB, ≤ 16384 px per side, and ≤ 50 MP
- `2560 × 1440` (16:9) is the recommended master size; width ≥ 2000 px minimum
- Keep roughly the left 50%–58% calm and low-contrast for native home content;
  place the subject in the right 58%–88% without touching the edge
- Use pure edge-to-edge background art only: no window chrome, sidebar, cards,
  buttons, composer, readable text, logo, or watermark
- The prompt-ready composition template and negative prompt live in
  [`docs/reference-background-prompt-guide.md`](../docs/reference-background-prompt-guide.md)

## Adaptive image themes

The renderer treats every image as a theme input instead of assuming a fixed
character palette. It downsamples the image in a local Canvas to estimate
brightness, accent color, visual focus, left/right safe area, and aspect ratio.
The pixels stay in the Codex renderer; there is no upload or external API call.
If Canvas analysis is unavailable, the theme falls back to a safe default and
the detected Codex shell/OS appearance.

Theme metadata is optional. The defaults are deliberately adaptive:

```json
{
  "appearance": "auto",
  "art": {
    "focusX": 0.72,
    "focusY": 0.45,
    "safeArea": "auto",
    "taskMode": "auto"
  }
}
```

- `appearance`: `auto`, `light`, or `dark`. `auto` follows the native
  Codex/ChatGPT or OS appearance; an explicit value wins. Image luminance
  still informs palette and composition, but never overrides the user's UI mode.
- `art.focusX` / `art.focusY`: normalized `0..1` coordinates used for
  `background-position` (left/top is `0`, right/bottom is `1`).
- `art.safeArea`: `auto`, `left`, `right`, `center`, or `none`. Automatic mode
  finds the lower-information side so native home content does not cover the
  subject. Use `none` when the artwork should fill the composition evenly.
- `art.taskMode`: `auto`, `ambient`, `banner`, `full`, or `off`. Ultra-wide art
  automatically uses a full-width task banner with a vertical fade; standard
  art uses a quieter ambient layer. `full` keeps the artwork at normal strength
  with only the baseline readability veil; `off` removes the task-page artwork
  while leaving the rest of the theme active.

The image-derived palette is used unless a theme explicitly supplies color
fields. Explicit art metadata (`focusX`, `focusY`, `safeArea`, `taskMode`) has
the same priority over automatic inference. The home route remains expressive;
task routes keep native content, cards, composer, and code readable above the
image layer.

CLI example:

```bash
~/.codex/codex-dream-skin-studio/scripts/customize-theme-macos.sh \
  --image "/path/to/image.png" \
  --name "My theme" \
  --accent "#7cff46" \
  --secondary "#36d7e8" \
  --highlight "#642a8c"
```

To tune composition without changing the image, pass the adaptive fields to
the image loader:

```bash
~/.codex/codex-dream-skin-studio/scripts/load-image-theme-macos.sh \
  --file "/path/to/image.png" \
  --appearance auto \
  --focus-x 0.72 --focus-y 0.45 \
  --safe-area left --task-mode banner
```

Reset to the bundled abstract demo:

```bash
~/.codex/codex-dream-skin-studio/scripts/customize-theme-macos.sh --reset-demo
```

## What this is not

- Not an OpenAI product and not a fork of Codex source
- Not a way to patch or rebrand the official binary
- Not a Windows build (see `../windows/`)
- Not an API proxy: theming does not change model providers or API keys

If you use a third-party API relay, configure it separately — keep theme install and API config as two explicit steps.
